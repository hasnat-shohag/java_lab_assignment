JAVA and Network Programming
Assignment-1
1. Write a program that prompts the user to enter the minutes (e.g., 1 billion), and displays the number of years and days for the minutes. For simplicity, assume a year has 365 days. 

Here is a sample run:

Enter the number of minutes: 1000000000
1000000000 minutes is approximately 1902 years and 214 days
2. Write a program that prompts the user to enter two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and displays their distance between them.

Here is a sample run:

Enter x1 and y1: 1.5 -3.4
Enter x2 and y2: 4 5
The distance between the two points is 8.764131445842194

3. Write a program that displays the following table. Cast floating point numbers into integers.
A	 b	 pow(a, b)
1	 2 	1
2	 3	 8
3	 4	 81
4 	5 	1024
5 	6	 15625

4. Write a program that reads in investment amount, annual interest rate, and number of years, and displays the future investment value using the following formula:
futureInvestmentValue = investmentAmount * (1 + monthlyInterestRate)numberOfYears*12
For example, if you enter amount 1000, annual interest rate 3.25%, and number of years 1, the future investment value is 1032.98.

Here is a sample run:
Enter investment amount: 1000.56
Enter annual interest rate in percentage: 4.25
Enter number of years: 1
Accumulated value is $1043.92

5. Write a program to read a Name as a String given in a single line and separate the name into three parts: FirstName, MiddleName, and LastName. Then print the three parts of the name in three different lines.

Here is a sample run:
Enter the Full Name: Sujoy Kumar Paul
First Name: Sujoy
Middle Name: Kumar
Last Name: Paul
